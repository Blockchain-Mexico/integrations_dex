### Integration Dex

Basically: towards a new kind of virtual machine.

### Quant bot integration
Is just a backend wrapper service.
The landscape of smart contract (stack )

1.- Data -> Aggregators -> creditMultiprotocol -> ?

And the lib implementation so far.

1. Just using the lib, create another smart contract with another sol doing sutff, a python implementation.
This is lookng for a wrapper and manipulatation with typescript of strings.

##Features 

[Semi ready looking for v2] Wallet connect appproach
[semi ready] the graph and the abi 
[deprecated in v4?] 0x wrapper 
[is pretty silly ] Towards the  Defi Virtaul Machine 


Toward to multi -Defi Virtual machines:
Some day this will be deprecated so:
The integration could be a dedicated descentralized approach:
The EVM is general purpose the DeFi require a one dedicated Virtual Machine

For do that need to start a new EIP 
We have different types of EVM and L2 stuff
https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html

But there is not a dedicated virtual machine just for Defi.

Promises:

Sckeptical implentations is there is not a real hint for implentation.

Security
A dedicated EVM can create more security in re-entrace concerns.
The reverse engineering in a just one function for specific stack move is more hard.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
